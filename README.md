# ClanTeam
The Clan Team plugin is designed for the Oxide modding framework, specifically for Rust game servers. It automatically manages and organizes clan members into teams, ensuring that players within the same clan are grouped together. This plugin leverages the Clans plugin to retrieve clan information and manage team assignments.
